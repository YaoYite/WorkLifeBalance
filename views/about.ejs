          <p>Our website focuses on the family of those who have work as their main priority, sometimes to the point of an addiction to work. Since these people may not be aware of the negative influences 
          of spending too much time on work. We provide sequential services for their family, from an assessment to determine whether the person may experience
          health risks, to suggestions of how to improve their work life balance. We also look to increase family's understanding 
          of potential workaholicsâ€™ work life balance and help them improve their quality of life.</p>
