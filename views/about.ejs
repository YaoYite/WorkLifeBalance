          <p>Our website focuses on a family of workaholics, since workaholics may be not aware of the negative influence 
          of spending too much time on work. We provide sequential services for their family, from an assessment of 
          workaholic to tips of helping workaholics back to life. In this way, the family would have a better understanding 
          of workaholicsâ€™ work and life balance and help them to improve their life quality.</p>
